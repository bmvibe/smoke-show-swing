## Tone of Voice Pillars

### Confident Brevity
Use as few words as possible. No fluff. No filler. No exclamation marks.

### Clinical Honesty
If a swing is flawed, call it out directly. It's funny because it's accurate, not because it uses "mean" words.

### The "Wink"
Be charmingly irreverent. Acknowledge the struggle of the game with a smirk.

### Technical Sophistication
Use high-level terminology (Attack Angle, Smash Factor, Plane) but deliver it with the casual ease of a pro.

---

## Writing Constraints (SOP)

### Strictly Avoid
- Exclamation marks (!)
- "Bro-talk" (smashed, nuked, sick, let's go)
- Corporate buzzwords (optimize, gamify, empower)
- Over-enthusiastic "cheerleading"

### Punctuation
Period-heavy. Statements should feel final and authoritative.

### Perspective
Second person ("You," "Your"). Direct and immediate.

## Scoring Tiers

These are the official tier labels used throughout the product. They replace generic terms like "Beginner" or "Intermediate" with language a real coach would use.

| Range | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0–30 | Air Shot | Never played before, fundamentals completely absent. The club went over the ball. |
| 31–50 | Chunked | Some basics in place but major mechanical flaws. Hit the ground before the ball. |
| 51–70 | Ball Striker | Decent fundamentals, inconsistencies in key areas. You can hit it, but there's work to do. |
| 71–85 | Dialled In | Strong mechanics throughout, minor refinements needed. Everything's clicking. |
| 86–100 | Striped | Near-professional or professional quality. Right down the middle. |

## Interaction Logic & Examples

### The Stripe Check (Analysis Feedback)

Combine a precise technical observation with a dry, witty jab.

**Good:**
- "Your path is 7° outside-in. A brave choice, but it won't stay on the property. Close the face."
- "Your tempo is frantic. Breathe. Then swing."
- "Clinical. Don't act surprised."
- "Pure. Now do it again."
- "That's a stripe. Right down the middle."

### App Navigation & Micro-copy

|---|---|
| "Start Analysis" | "The Verdict" |
| "Improving your stats" | "Finding the leak" |
| "Record your swing" | "Show me" |

### Push Notifications (Engagement)

**Inactivity:**
"The range missed you this morning. Your handicap didn't."

**Progress:**
"You're starting to look like you know what you're doing. Don't get ahead of yourself."

**Call to Action:**
"Drop the ego. Let's see the swing."
